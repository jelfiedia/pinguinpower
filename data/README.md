| Kwargs for read_csv      | If you are working in Python and use the read_csv function in pandas to load data, these parameters will help you load the data properly.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Nest error timeseries    | The scoring metric has per-observation weights for the error based on the precision of the original observation. We provide this information in the same format as the Nest count timeseries for local validation while building models. The numbers provided are the precision, which are the inverse of the weights for residuals. |
| Submission Format        | This is the submission format for the competition. It is the same structure as the nest count timeseries, but it is for the seasons that are not provided (2014 - 2017). You should predict nest counts.                                                                                                                             |
| Nest count timeseries    | A transformation of the nest counts from the raw observations. This format matches the submission format for the competition, but it is for historical years (through the 2013 season).                                                                                                                                              |
| All penguin observations | Contains all of the observation data for three species of penguins (gentoo, adelie, chinstrap) through the 2013 season.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
